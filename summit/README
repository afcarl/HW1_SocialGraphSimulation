Usage:
    python gen_pwlaw_graph.py [ probability ] [ birth rate data ] [ death rate data ] [ output dir ]

Evaluation:
    python evaluation.py [ your graph ]

Notes:
    1.	Probability for our result is set to 0.8
    2.	Birth rate data and death rate data must be in the exact format
    3.	Output will contain many graphs which are labeled by the iteration
	Will restore the result each 10 iteration, as well as the result whose total nodes exceeds 8000 
	The life time distribution and age distribution will be shown at the very last of the generating program
    4.	Evaluation results will be show by stdio
